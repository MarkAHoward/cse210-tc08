# Batter
What's your batting average? Find out with this terminal version of the arcade 
classic. The goal is simple. Just bat the ball at the blricks until there are 
none left. If you miss the ball the game is over.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and asciimatics 1.12.0 or new installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Asciimatics by opening a terminal

python3 -m pip install asciimatics
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
